# Books-Repo API

## Overview

The Books-Repo API is a RESTful web service designed to manage a digital repository of books. This API supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to interact with a PostgreSQL database that stores book data. The application is built with Deno, utilizing Hono.js for routing and Drizzle ORM for seamless database interaction.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new books to the repository.
- **Read**: Retrieve details of all books or a specific book by ID.
- **Update**: Modify existing book details.
- **Delete**: Remove books from the repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Deno**: The project is built with Deno. Ensure Deno is installed on your machine. You can install Deno from [Deno's installation page](https://deno.land/#installation).
- **PostgreSQL**: You will need PostgreSQL installed and running on your system. This database will store the books data.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
